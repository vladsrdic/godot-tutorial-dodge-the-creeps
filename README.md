## Dodge the Creeps

Made using this tutorial: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html

This is just my first time playing with the Godot engine. This simple game covers all the basics of the engine and I plan to use it as a reference if/when I forget things!

Supports controllers

Controls:
* Arrow keys for movement (left joystick)
* Space to start a new game (A or X button)
